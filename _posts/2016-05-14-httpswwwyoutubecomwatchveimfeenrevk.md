Wanted to share the original "Sons of Thunder" prophecy with you.

This prophecy from James Ryle, the man who prophesied the Promise Keepers movement. What has now come to be known as the Sons of Thunder prophecy was a set of three dreams that has been confirmed by prophets and musicians throughout the world. Whenever I listen to it, it stirs something in me, and I hear a voice in my spirit that says, "This was meant for you."

I bought a blue guitar for this very reason. It was a symbol of my commitment to the Lord --- my way of saying, "Lord, I want to be a Sons of Thunder."

Enjoy!
