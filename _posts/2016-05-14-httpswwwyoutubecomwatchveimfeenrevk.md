Sons of Thunder

This prophecy from James Ryle, the man who prophesied the Promise Keepers movement. What has now come to be known as the Sons of Thunder prophecy was a set of three dreams that has been confirmed by prophets and musicians throughout the world. Whenever I listen to it, it stirs something in me, and I hear a voice in my spirit that says, "This was meant for you."

I bought a blue guitar for this very reason. It was a symbol of my commitment to the Lord --- my way of saying, "Lord, I want to be a Sons of Thunder."
